Express: Popular Node.js web framework for building APIs and applications.
Body-parser: Middleware for parsing incoming request bodies.
CORS: Middleware for enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) requests. Â  
ts-node-dev: Development tool for running TypeScript files directly without compilation.
jsonwebtoken: Library for generating and verifying JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) for authentication.
Database:
NoSQL: Scalable and flexible data storage solution (specific database choice not defined).
Indexing: Enables efficient data retrieval based on specific criteria.
Caching: Improves performance by storing frequently accessed data in memory.
Authentication:
Firebase: Cloud backend platform for user authentication, storage, and other services.
Location Services: Provides user location information for potential delivery features.
